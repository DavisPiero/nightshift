# Hand-off: end of session 15 (2026-10-31)

## Repo state
- On `main`, everything committed and pushed; no other branches. `main` is the live site. Next work goes on a new branch; merge only when David signs off (he says "push" for merge everything and push).

## Read first
`CLAUDE.md`, `STATE.md`, the last 15 lines of `DECISIONS.md`.

## What comes next
1. Ask David the questions in STATE.md, starting with the GT3 and Formula cars.
2. If he brings notes from playing, or from watching Arlo, use `/notes` first.
3. Tune difficulty by people playing, not the bench.

## How the career works
- `src/career/career.js` has the events, levels and pay; `node tools/career-bench.mjs` proves them and checks every event fits its track.
- A new stage: add events and acts, set `tier` and `price` on cars in `cars.js`, take the "to be continued" out of `signed` in `story.js` and `LATER`.
- A new scene: add it to `SCENES` in `story.js`, name it as an event's `before` or `after`. A new picture: a line in `SHOTS` or a branch in `tools/story-paint.mjs`, then `node tools/story-art.mjs`, and an entry in `FX` in `cutscene.js`.
- A new car also needs `node tools/car-cards.mjs <id>`.
- `main.js` runs a race through `Race` (`buildRace`, `raceStep`); with `rivals: 0` it is plain free driving. Results and pay are in `screens.js` (`results`).
- Save version 6: `garage.cars[id] = { look }`, use `carLook(save, car)`. `career`: cr, xp, done, tracks, seen, difficulty.

## How cars work
- `GLB/<file>` goes in unchanged. A recipe in `tools/car-recipes.mjs` names slots by `material|node`. `node tools/capture-car.mjs <id>` writes `assets/cars/<id>.bin`, `<id>-lite.bin` (lod 2 iPad copy, lod 1 parked, which is also what rivals use) and `assets/cars/tex/`.
- Check the printed scale: near 1:1 means the recipe's `axles` fit. Helpers: `listIslands`, `findSteering`, `listCabinNear`. Always check a cockpit by turning the wheel.

## Open with David
